# HMap 

An HTML5 map for Die2Nite

All the assets are copyrighted by MotionTwin

## DISCLAMER

I made this map because we have no news from Motion Twin (MT) for a couple years now, and the end - death - of flash
is already announced. I like the game and I can see the community worrying days after days. Some are already leaving because 
they think the game will die with flash.

This code is open source because this is the rule that moderators use to allow an addon.

If Motion Twin sees an offense in this project and officially ask me to remove the code and delete this project I will do it.

If Motion Twin officially give me their blessing to continue this project, then I will remove this disclamer and licence 
the code under an open source licence.

 ## How to use
 
 At the moment the project is just a userscript, you can use your favorite userscript extension to install it.
 
 It has been tested with tampermonkey. You can learn how to use it here : https://tampermonkey.net/faq.php
 
 ## Known issues
 
 The map is still in a very early stage, so there is a lot of issues. Please read carefully this list before posting
 new ones.
 
  * The explorable ruins are not made at all
  * All the tools (grid, expeditions courses, ..) are not made
  * The kills are not displayed on the map
  * The scout has no detection
  * The paranoid effects are not made (static effect, distortion effect, blur..)
  * The fog of war is not as good as the original
